Hi <<name>>,

Thanks so much for submitting your project to the OpenCon 2017 Do-a-Thon! We're excited about your project. The next step is to get information about your project on our Github Issues page, where others will be able to discover and learn more about what types of support you need.  

**Please follow the following steps carefully:**

1)If you don't have one [already](https://aurl.org), create a Github account! Github is a platform for open source, collaborative working. We'll be using it as a space to manage do-a-thon projectsâ€”including yours! 

2) Share what kind of help you need by posting a Github issue at this link. This will act as a discussion thread where people can work together and talk about what your project needs. 

3) Give your issue a title. If your project has a name, it should include the project name, followed by a brief summary of what you need help with. 

E.g. Open Speakers Database: Creating Translated Versions of Website

or, if you don't have a project name, include a one-liner describing you're trying to do:

E.g. Translating searchable database of experts on Open Research & Education 

4) Start your issue by pasting in your Project Name & Description, exactly as below:  

Project name: The Method

Project description: The Method is an open source, peer reviewed podcast about the state of science. 

5) Now you can elaborate! Give some more information about your project and what kind of support you are looking for. We recommend that this isn't any longer than a paragraph, but if you need to add more detail, feel free to do so! 

6) Include project metadata at the bottom of your issue. Please copy and paste the following text (exactly as it appears) into your issue. This helps provide the correct metadata so others can easily search for your project! 

Issue area: Open Science

Help needed: Other

Region: Northern America

We'll come in to add some labels to your issue so it's documented properly, and then you're good to go! Keep your eye on your issue discussion thread for updates from collaborators, and follow these tips for effectively leading a project during the do-a-thon.

Good luck!

Joe & Lorraine
