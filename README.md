# OpenCon Do-A-Thon development site readme (this will be the only thing here when come out of testing)

Hi! *waves*. If you're here looking for the OpenCon Do-A-Thon area we're afraid you took a wrong turn. This is [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon). In this repo we code up the site that powers it in a place that we can mess up without causing problems and talk about other tech in issues.

If that sounds like what you're after though... then welcome, nice of you to join us. Take a peak at our [contributing guide](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon-dev/blob/master/.github/contributing.md) or [issues](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon-dev/issues) for how to get involved.

Once the do-a-thon is over, we'll be inviting others to use all our learnings and code to make their own do-a-thon, so your contributions will matter long after the event!
